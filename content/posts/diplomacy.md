### 1. How does digitalization impact the core functions of diplomacy? 
Several states have now streamlined digital issues into their foreign policies, adopting strategies and appointing designated diplomats to pursue these strategic objectives. “Digital diplomacy” refers to the use of new technologies and social media by diplomats in the context of their traditional activities, including for consular purposes. 
AI applications may be appropriate and can provide important opportunities to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including knowledge management, information collection, monitoring programmes, discourses understanding, and delivering services. 

How does AI fit within the organisational culture of the MFA? There are important limitations for the MFA related to the lack of skills in digital humanities in general and in particular in Natural Language Processing and the lack of awareness of appropriate AI tools to be used by diplomats. 
How can capacity-building needs in big data diplomacy be addressed? 

First by Identifying needs: Existing capacities and capacity gaps need to be carefully identified, keeping in mind that not every diplomat needs to have the same level of familiarity with Ai and big data.

Second, Offering different levels of training. For this purpose I propose overview of training materials in the Social Sciences & Humanities cluster.


### 2. Landscape of training materials in the Social Sciences & Humanities cluster 

Research  “Inventory of existing learning materials”  provide an overview of training materials in the Social Sciences & Humanities cluster.

The goal of the project was to aggregate the information about training materials and make it available and discoverable to the potential learner. Around 30 sources of training material of various kinds and scopes have been gathered initially. These were analysed along a number of dimensions, like intended audience, relevant discipline, topics covered, ex-tent, status etc. Additionally, for most of the sources a few individual training material items were picked and described in further detail. All this information has been collected through a dedicated Drupal-based application. 

The application is currently available on the website 

[Social Sciences & Humanities Open Cloud](https://training-inventory.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/) 

There are four types of training materi-als: e-learning courses, carpentry-style, blog-style, static (slides, videos, PDFs).

The Social Sciences & Humanities Open Cloud is the sources of training material of various kinds and scopes. It is  intended as the primary user-facing discovery application to find training materials and other information regarding research practices.
 
### 3. AI in the Public Sector

In Latvia the implementation of AI solutions has been identified as one of the priorities of Latvia’s public administration. In February 2020, the Latvian government released its national AI strategy on Developing Artificial Intelligence Solutions. The objective of the Latvian strategy is to promote the uptake and growth of AI in the whole economy.

The proposed strategy outlines policy actions in the following areas and devotes particular attention to the promotion of AI in the public administration:
- Raising the awareness of and competences in AI across society through education reforms;
- Promoting the adoption and development of AI in the public and private sector;
- Actively engage in national and international cooperation;
- Developing an appropriate legal and ethical framework for AI;
- Unleashing the benefits of a well-developed data ecosystem;
- Investing in a digital and telecommunication infrastructure to support AI developments.

The Latvian AI strategy highlights investment projections in line with the recommendations of the Coordinated Plan. 
These estimations amount at a public investment of 25 million EUR per year, and a total investment (public and private sectors combined) of 74 million EUR per year. More concrete investment plans will be defined and released at a later stage.

In order to increase the government’s commitment to the digital agenda  Latvia’s Digital Transformation Guidelines 2021-2027 have been elaborated. “Lines for action’ include:
- Data economy
- Government as a platform;
- Digitally first;
- Open by default 
- ICT governance reform.

Different value chain ecosystem pilot projects have been under the implementation in Latvia:  (1) ICT (2) Biomedicine; (3) Smart materials, (4) Smart city, (5) BIO economy, and (6) Smart energy.

In practice it means development of collaboration platforms bringing together entrepreneurs, research/education institutions and public administration, including Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Latvia has made 5G commercial frequencies available from the 1st of January 2019. The major impact of 5G will be found in almost all sectors of society, from harbours and airports to hospitals and entire cities.
The Baltic Sea Region 5G Ecosystem Forum “5G Techritory” facilitated new partnerships among global and regional information communication technology companies, and other key stakeholders in Europe.

We could mention best examples such as Artificial Intelligence solu-tions for translation of small languages, AI for road safety, AI for Com-puter vision along with implementation of 5G mobile technologies and fast, affordable high speed broadband Internet and public WIFI net-works.

### 4. Neural machine translation 

Machine translation technologies can be applied in public administration and Latvian diplomatic service. Language is an essential treasure for Latvia and every European country. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that European AI is multilingual. Latvia has advancing leadership in multilingual AI technologies. It will enable all Europeans to benefit from AI developments, all businesses to provide and use AI based services across borders.

According to Tilde (2020), neural machine translation produces more fluent, humanlike translations, substantially boosting the level of MT quality and accuracy.

Neural MT systems built by Tilde won first place at World Machine translation a global competition between the World’s top language technology providers, for two consecutive years.

The main principle of Neural machine translation work is that it keeps track of pairs of source and target language translation in the memory or also database, which are kept until it is needed to use them. 

As a result, neural machine translation includes many translation pairs.  The basis of neural machines is neural networks that are composed of thousands of artificial units resembling neurons in their output or activation.

How Ministry of Foreign Affairs could use machine translation technologies? 

EU Council Presidency Translator developed by our leading language technology company Tilde has supported seven EU Council Presidencies, starting from Latvian.

Tilde developed a set of multiple domain-specific MT systems for IBM. The systems are used by IBM for translating to and from Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian languages.  Using its MT platform, Tilde was able to boost the quality of the Nordic-language systems through the integration of indomain terminology.  Tilde’s MT systems have been integrated into IBM’s translation workflows. To facilitate multilingual communication in Europe, Tilde is helping the European Commission to build a pan-European MT infra-structure.

The systems in CEF.AT will be integrated into public online services, such as Europeana, the Open Data Portal, and the Online Dispute Resolution platform.  Tilde applied MT solutions for Graze to provide news monitoring in the Arabic, Chinese, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish and French languages. Kantar TNS and Tilde IT have launched a strategic partnership to develop speech recognition technology for monitoring and analyzing broadcast/ podcast content in Lithuania and Latvia.

### 5. Lexicometry to Study Political Tweets.

I analized research conducted by Marge Käsper, Liina Maurer, who investigated Lexicometry to Study Political Tweets.

Marge Käsper, Liina Maurer   explored the tools, various methods and specific objects of study to discuss subsequently, for a socio-discursive perspective, the Twitter as a mode of communication for a president. According  to their opinion, today the most significant work in lexicometry has been produced by Damon Mayaffre, who has analyzed comparative recurrences and vocabulary patterns in public speeches of all French presidents from de Gaulle to Chirac, and later on up to Emmanuel Macron. Their conclusions may be also useful for my future research as our Ministry analyses different discourses, including political tweets of different countries of the world performed in different languages. 

### 6. Conclusions

1. AI applications may be appropriate and can provide important opportunities to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including knowledge management, information collection, monitoring programmes, discourses understanding, and delivering services. 

2. Diplomats could improve skills in digital humanities in general and Natural Language Processing in particular  using online materials and e courses.

3. It could be helpful in daily work of diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and embassies to use new ways of analysis from social media discourse, and to analyse comparative recurrences and vocabulary patterns in public speeches. In this regard, it is important to stress the significance of promoting digital skills of diplomats.  

4. As work at the ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely connected with almost all countries in the world and their respective languages, translations, including machine translation quality is an important aspect in daily work. 

5. A language technology platform with Machine translation, speech, and terminology management functionalities can be integrated into public governmental websites and systems to ensure dynamic content translation. 
Today’s dynamic world with changing external and internal political /economic environment  limited resources, increasing demand from the society to receive high-quality and modern services creates new challenges for the public administration. The public administration needs to evolve and adapt to changing needs, providing effective services and flexible solutions, using innovative approaches. To achieve these goals, it is vital to invest in the intellectual capacity of the public administration and improve its methods and culture of work.

6. It could be helpful in daily work of diplomats at the MFA and embassies to use new ways of analysis from social media discourse, and to analyse comparative recurrences and vocabulary patterns in public speeches. In this regard, it is important to stress the significance of promoting digital skills of diplomats.  Tilde has partnership relations with the Latvian public administration is creating a language technology platform with MT, speech, and terminology management functionalities. The platform can be integrated into public governmental websites and systems to ensure dynamic content translation. The next step of the project will be to introduce a set of virtual assistants to improve accessibility to public services.

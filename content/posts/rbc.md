## III ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

The actions of companies have significant impacts on the lives of citizens around the world. Not just in terms of the products and services they offer or the jobs and opportunities they create, but also in terms of working conditions, human rights, health, the environment, innovation, education and training.

For this reason, citizens rightly expect that companies understand their positive and negative impacts on society and the environment. 

And, therefore, prevent, manage and mitigate any negative impact that they may cause, including within their global supply chain. Living up to this duty is commonly known as 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR) used in the UN and the EU or 'responsible business conduct' (RBC) - globaly, including the OECD.

### WHY IS RBC IS IMPORTANT?

A responsible business model will help to ensure that people are paid a living wage, that men and women are treated with equal dignity and provided equal opportunity, that their right to organise is respected, their health and safety attended to in the work place and their communities protected. In sum, the private sector will contribute to a marked improvement of these people’s lives through a higher and more evenly distributed standard of living. This contributes to development in the affected countries and can also counteract the widespread corruption (that often characterises developing countries). So for society, RBC offer a set of values on which we can build a more cohesive society and on which we can base the transition to a sustainable economic system.

For enterprises Businesses also stand to gain from acting responsibly. Responsible businesses are more likely to obtain and retain the “social licence” to operate, a critical component of profitability and long-term business strategy. Responsible business practices are also an efficient way to manage risks, diversify portfolios, and increase productivity. For example, environmentally friendly production processes can significantly decrease overall costs and effective management of labour practices in supply chains can boost productivity and protect brand capital.
For the  economy, RBC make companies more sustainable and innovative, which contributes to a more sustainable economy

Most businesses are good. They pay their taxes, they create employment, they abide by the laws, and they generally contribute to the societies in which they operate. 

But unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. And when businesses behave badly, the human consequences can be devastating: factories collapse killing thousands; workers, often children, are treated like slaves; rivers, lakes, and even seas are rendered lifeless, and entire species are threatened.

In order to deal with cases of bad business behaviour such as these, we would need a multilateral system where victims of this type of treatment could complain, and the person receiving the complaint would analyse it, see if it’s valid, alert all the parties involved, and sit down with them to help fix the situation.

In fact, this is something that already exists: institutions called the National Contact Points (NCPs) NCP for RBC.


### OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises – 

The Guidelines were first adopted in 1976 and today 46 governments have signed up. Implementation mechanism through National Contacts Points (NCPs)- 
To date, 48 governments have an NCP for RBC

OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 
Main features
        - Comprehensive government-backed recommendations for responsible business conduct
	- Developed and updated in close consultation with business, trade unions and NGOs
        - Applicable worldwide
        - Based on universally shared values, principles, and norms
        - Recommendations  to multinational enterprises operating in or from the territories of adhering Governments

The OECD Guidelines are the leading international standard for responsible business conduct for multinational enterprises wherever they operate in the world. They cover all areas of business ethics, including human rights, labour issues, environmental protection, anti-bribery, taxation, and science and technology. They operate on the expectation that businesses should not only do good, but that they should also do no harm. 
Some examples of sector projects: 
        - NEW: Artificial intelligence
	- Guidance for responsible minerals supply chains
	- Guidance for investors in agricultural supply chains
	- Guidance for responsible textiles supply chains
        - Guidance on due diligence for the financial sector

#### Principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI

1. Inclusive and sustainable growth and well-being
Stakeholders should proactively engage in responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI to invigorate sustainable economic growth and to improve well-being. 
Human-centred values and fairness
AI actors should respect human rights and democratic values, including freedom, dignity, autonomy, privacy, non-discrimination, diversity, fairness and social justice, and core labour rights throughout the AI system lifecycle.
To this effect, they should implement internationally-recognised standards of responsible business conduct and carry out risk-based due diligence to identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts associated with AI system lifecycles. They should implement safeguards and consider mechanisms, such as capacity for human final determination, that are appropriate to the context and benefit from multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder collaboration, and assess the effectiveness of these mechanisms on an ongoing basis.

2. Transparency and explainability
Stakeholders should promote a culture of transparency and responsible disclosure regarding AI systems. 
More specifically, AI actors should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context and the state of art, to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace, to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to understand and challenge the outcome, and to foster a general understanding of AI systems.

3. Robustness and safety
AI systems should be robust and safe throughout their entire lifecycle so that they can both withstand or overcome adverse conditions and avoid posing unreasonable safety risk in conditions of normal or foreseeable use or misuse. 
To this end, AI actors should ensure traceability of the datasets, processes and decisions made during the AI system lifecycle to enable understanding of its outcomes and responses to inquiry, where appropriate. 
AI actors should address risks related to AI systems, including digital security risk, by applying a systematic risk management cycle to each phase of the AI system lifecycle on a continuous basis.

4. Accountability
AI actors should account for how adverse impacts associated with AI system lifecycles are addressed, be accountable for the proper functioning of AI systems and for the respect of the above principles, based on their roles, the context, and the state of art.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF ETHICAL AI PRINCIPLES

To implement ethical AI principles, companies have taken steps including:

- Conducting human right impact assessments on emerging technologies
- Driving collaboration and dialogue through industry and multi-stakeholder platforms
- Putting in place governance structures, such as internel review committees
- Advocating for public policy aimed at mitigating human rights risks related to AI
